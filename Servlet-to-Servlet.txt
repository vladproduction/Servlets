To connect two servlets in Java, you can use request forwarding or include mechanism. Here's how you can do it:

1. Using Request Forwarding:
   - In the servlet from which you want to connect to another servlet, you need to acquire the RequestDispatcher 
   object using either `getRequestDispatcher(String path)` or `getNamedDispatcher(String name)` method from 
   the `HttpServletRequest` object.
   - Provide the path or name of the target servlet to the dispatcher object.
   - Forward the request using the `forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)` method of the 
   dispatcher object.
   
   Here's an example of how the code looks like:

   ```java
   // FirstServlet.java
   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
       // Get the RequestDispatcher object for the target servlet
       RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("/SecondServlet");
       
       // Forward the request to the target servlet
       dispatcher.forward(request, response);
   }
   ```

   ```java
   // SecondServlet.java
   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
       // Process the request
       // ...
   }
   ```
   
2. Using Request Include:
   - In the servlet from which you want to include the output of another servlet, you need to acquire the 
   RequestDispatcher object in the same way as described above.
   - Use the `include(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)` method of the dispatcher object to 
   include the output of the target servlet.
   
   Here's an example of how the code looks like:
   
   ```java
   // FirstServlet.java
   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
       // Get the RequestDispatcher object for the target servlet
       RequestDispatcher dispatcher = request.getRequestDispatcher("/SecondServlet");
       
       // Include the output of the target servlet
       dispatcher.include(request, response);
   
       // Continue processing the response
       // ...
   }
   ```

   ```java
   // SecondServlet.java
   protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
       // Generate the output
       // ...
   }
   ```

These mechanisms allow you to connect multiple servlets and pass control or include the output of one servlet in the other.
